# Software Defined Radio labs

This repo contains some simple labs for software defined radios (SDRs).  I am developing these to be used in conjunction
with the undergraduate and graduate digital communications classes at New York University.  The initial labs are based on
the simple [ADALM-Pluto boards](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html)
from Analog Devices. In these labs, I will use the simple [MATLAB interface](https://www.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/plutoradio/ug/install-support-package-for-pluto-radio.html).  NYU students enrolled in the class will be able to borrow a Pluto device from the instructor.  All NYU students also have free access to MATLAB.
