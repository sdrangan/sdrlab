In this lab, you will learn to:
 
* Create a sequence of QAM symbols
* Design an FIR interpolation filter
* Upsample and modulate the symbols with the designed filter
* Select the appropriate backoff for the TX
* Measure the TX and RX PSD
* Continuously measure the RX PSD to create a simple spectrum analyzer
